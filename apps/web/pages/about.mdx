        # Efficient Frontier

        An overview of yearn's vaults performance that considers risk factors so you can compare them with other DeFi assets. This table will plot yield options in the following axes:

        - **Return:** How much yield does this option generates (higher is better)
        - **Volatility:** How much does the yield vary over time (lower means less risk)

        In this graph you will find a region where the most risk-efficient assets are, that is the "Efficient Frontier" (highlighted with the red crayon square):
